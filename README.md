# Designing-a-4-Wheel-Steering-Mechanism-
Proposing a solution to the prevalent issue of traffic congestion in the Greater Cairo Metropolitan Area, this study introduces a novel four-wheel steering mechanism aimed at enhancing urban mobility. The prototype was also 3D printed.
To simplify the mechanism, we employed the use of gears to allow easier application of the four-wheel steering mechanism. The design can be divided into two parts, front and rear. The front comprises a turning rod that is attached to the front gear. Upon rotation, the gear translates the motion to the two front wheels causing them to turn in the same direction of rotation. The same gear is also connected through two connecting rods to the rear gear. This movement causes the rear gear to rotate in the opposite direction thus resulting in the opposite rotation of the rear wheels thus achieving the four-wheel steering mechanism. The final assembly can be sectioned into 5 different subsections; the base, the moving rack, the gear mechanism, the steering rod, and finally the wheel subassembly. The design was done on SolidWorks.
